# Web Development Resourcesüíª

## Hello üëã
 This repository was made initially as a resource guide for students participating in the Kode with Klossy Web Development Camps for Summer 2020, however, it is also now a crowdsource place full of useful sources to learn about web development along other with other useful tools - such as navigating Git and using Github - as you navigate your time as a developer. 
 
 I will be continually updating this repository throughout time, however, feel free to fork the repo or make contributions here!

 ### EXTENSION: Building Your Own KWK Portfolio!
 Throughout the duration of the web development camp, you will be building a lot of very cool projects so why not show them off? A porfolio would be a great way to showcase all the projects you've done to show off to your friends, family, recruiters, etc.

See this [tutorial](https://medium.com/techtogether/how-to-make-your-first-portfolio-hosted-on-github-1e5940853fcc) I wrote on how to host your website through Github pages

Here is another [resource](https://github.dev/) to help you build a portfolio to showcase your projects! If you are a student and have a school email, you can register for [Github Pro](https://education.github.com/pack) that gives you free tools to use like a .me domain and other resources
